# My 2023 Coding Edition

## Introduction

Hi! Back in February I wrote a post about my 2023 goals. The roadmap for 2023 [can be found here](https://blog.gabrielkaszewski.dev/posts/roadmap-for-2023/).

## Rust venture

In that post I had mentioned that I would like to do some Rust programming, especially to make some 2D games in it and to create apps in Tauri. Well, I did code in Rust this year, but I didn't do any of the things I had mentioned. Not in a sense that I would be satisfied with.

I managed to make a simple 2d space shooting game in Bevy üòÅ which was a recreation of the same game I made in C. [repo for rust game](https://github.com/GKaszewski/asteroids-rs), [repo for C game](https://github.com/GKaszewski/asteroids).

I wrote a screensaver which was a Conway's game of life. Pretty cool project, I used Raylib for drawing stuff. [repo for screensaver](https://github.com/GKaszewski/screensaver/).

I also wrote a tetris game, also using Raylib ( I fell in love with that library. It is amazing.) [repo for tetris](https://github.com/GKaszewski/tetris-rs/).

I tried to write a chip-8 emulator but I can't say that, that project was successful. I mean it kinda works on some ROMs but not for every ROM. So there is a room for improvement. [repo](https://github.com/GKaszewski/chip8)

I have also wrote some other small stuff like qr-generator web app using axum, a simple CLI tool for converting jpgs and pngs to webp, av1-encoder microservice, and tech tree system for maybe future RTS game. All of those projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/GKaszewski).

## Machine Learning venture

I have not done anything with machine learning, maybe next year üòâ. Okay that is not entirely true. I have done some stuff with machine learning but it was during my college machine learning course.

## Game development venture

I have not managed to finish my Sammy Suricate clone. I have not done anything with VR. I have experimented with Godot, melon.js and C.

I think that in the future (2024) I am going to focus on Godot. I find that engine really nice to work with.

I wrote some small games (tic-tac-toe, snake, asteroids) in C this year. It was fun. I really like C, but build system is a pain on Windows so I am planning to switch to zig or rust.

Also for my bachleor thesis I am making my own game engine in C++ with SFML and EnTT for ECS. Maybe I will write a post about it in the future and make some games in it üòÅ.

## Conclusion

Overall I am satisfied with 2023. I started to learn Rust and Godot. I have done some cool projects. Let's see what 2024 will bring üòÅ.
