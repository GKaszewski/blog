# Your first program!

Hello, today I'll teach you how to code! Seems interesting, doesn't it? Okay, let's start.

## Set up

Firstly you'll need to install Python. You can do so by clicking [this link](https://www.python.org/) which will redirect you to the Python official website.
Having installed this, you can download and install any code editor you'd like.
I prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , so I'll go with it. Now, we can finally start writing our first program!

## Writing code

Create a new file and name it `hello.py` and open it with your editor of choice. Now write this piece of code.

```python
print('Hello world')
```

## Running code

To run code, simply type in Terminal/Console `python hello.py`

## Explanation

Okay, so what does this code exactly do? Well, it prints text into the console or some other output device. In our case, the text is _Hello world_ . But why is the text in double-quotes? It is this way because otherwise, Python wouldn't know what does it mean. Is it a text or a variable<sup>1</sup> or something else. What would happen if we changed the text into something different, let's say _Hello, Darrien!_ I'll give you a moment to think about it.
...
Well, yes you've guessed it. It would print out `Hello, Darien!` to the console.

## Homework

Write a program that will greet your family members.
