## My roadmap for 2023

### üßë‚Äçüíª programming edition ‚ú®

### Preface

I've been thinking about writing this post since January. I sat down to write it several times at a time, but somehow I wasn't able to write it. Today, however, something nudged me and I took the plunge.

### üñ±Ô∏è Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è

Okay then, let's start with the technologies I would like to learn or play with.
At the very beginning it will be Rust. I've been thinking about **Rust** for quite some time, but somehow I've never moved it before more than out of curiosity some article/video I read or watched related to it. In January/February I started doing more 'practical' things in Rust, I write that in quotes because it's still not anything useful, but it was so-called testing the waters. I did naturally hello-world and some simple calculator in the console and an attempt to create an endless runner using [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/). Unfortunately, the runner was abandoned due to college sessions and a flurry of tasks at work.
Nevertheless, Rust got me interested and I feel like writing some simple 2D games in it especially since it has options to export to WebAssembly which suits me because I plan to target mainly the web for my projects. [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) also uses Rust, for those who don't know Tauri is a replacement for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), it allows cross-platform application development. I have two ideas for applications just in Tauri, but about them later.

The second technology is **Machine Learning**. Machine learning has become more and more popular lately; the famous [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/), or [stable-diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/), [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) and many other machine learning projects. Machine learning has interested me a lot since middle school, but somehow I can't grasp it. I understand the theory and how neural networks work, but I can't create a model that recognizes how many fingers we show, for example. I'd like to grasp this eventually and create one project I've been considering for about a year. It's a project that involves automatic audio de-noising, I know [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) has such filters, although I'd like to make my own software for this, yes for educational purposes. My next project is to automatically create .srt files based on song lyrics and audio. In January I created a [mod](https://github.com/GKaszewski/BeatLyrics) for [BeatSaber](https://beatsaber.com/) that adds song lyrics, unfortunately, the mod requires an srt file with the given time and lyrics. I would like to automate the process of creating these files, just using artificial intelligence to do it.

The last thing is **game dev** in a broad sense. Creating games in **_Typescript_**, making some games in VR in [Unity](https://unity.com/), finishing a clone of **_Sammy Suricate_**, and super if I could make some simple strategy game. I love RTS games.

### Conclusion (none)

That's pretty much it at the moment, it's pretty late and I think I'll keep updating this post as something else pops into this crazy head of mine. For now, this is my farewell to you and I wish you a good day.
